Using -> int hash = key % table->size;
Will lead sooner or later to a heap-buffer-overflow! 

The vulnerability was in the modulo operator,if there are any collisions
(two different keys map to the same index), the code handles this by chaining.
(linking all collided elements in a linked list).

The "key % table->size" can be an issue if key is negative, as it will produce a negative hash! 
leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
Since array indices must be non-negative, this can result in a buffer overflow.

Solved Using -> int hash = (key % table->size + table->size) % table->size;

This way, even if "key % table->size" is negative
adding table->size makes it positive!
then taking the modulo again ensures the result is within the correct range
[0, table->size - 1].
This prevents any attempt to access the array out of its bounds and thus avoids undefined behavior.

Other way to solve it, is to use -> int hash = abs(key % table->size);
We can use abs in this case because we are dealing with int values.
